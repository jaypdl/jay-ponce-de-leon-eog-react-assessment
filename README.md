## My Notes on the challenge

This was a really fun challenge to work on! 

I had never used TypeScript, GraphQL, or charted anything before. So it was a really good learning experience.

While I did hit MVP and have a chart updating with real-time data, I don't really consider it "complete".

The next thing I would have done is re-organize the files and folders. 
This was my first time working with the organizing by "features" model, and I feel like I could have definitely done a bettter job.
I also forgot to remove commented-out/dead code in my final rush.

I had two different reducers, I think it would have made more sense to have them combined as one.

As they say, hindsight is 20/20... 

I hope to hear from your team soon!

All the best,
